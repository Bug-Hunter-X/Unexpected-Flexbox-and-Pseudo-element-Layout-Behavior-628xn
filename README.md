# Unexpected Flexbox and Pseudo-element Layout Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon layout issue encountered when using CSS pseudo-elements (`:before` and `:after`) within flexbox containers.  The pseudo-elements do not always adhere to the parent's flexbox properties, resulting in unexpected positioning and overflow.

The `bug.css` file showcases the problem. `bugSolution.css` provides a solution to correct the layout issues.

## Problem

In certain scenarios, a pseudo-element within a flex container might ignore the flexbox layout rules, causing it to either overflow its container or fail to align properly with other flex items. This behavior can be particularly challenging to diagnose, as it's not always immediately obvious why the pseudo-element is not behaving as expected.

## Solution

The solution typically involves carefully considering the `display` property, and often requires using explicit sizing and positioning techniques to control the pseudo-element's behavior within the flexbox context.  The exact solution may vary depending on the specific layout requirements.
