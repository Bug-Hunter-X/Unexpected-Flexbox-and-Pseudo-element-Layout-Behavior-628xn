The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when using a pseudo-element like `::before` or `::after` within a flexbox container. The pseudo-element might not respect the flexbox properties of its parent element, leading to unexpected positioning or layout issues. For example, the pseudo-element might overflow its container or not align correctly with other flex items.
